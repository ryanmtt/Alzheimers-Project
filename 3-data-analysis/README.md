Code is split into primary and supplementary analysis:

(a) Primary analysis, involving interaction models with an Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and All-cause dementia outcome- `primary-analysis.R` 
(b) Supplementary analysis, including models split at age at baseline, binarised PRS scores, and Poisson models- `supplementary-analysis.R`

`primary-analysis.R` also contains the code to produce the figure in `Figure 3` and `Figure 4` of the manuscript.
